**discriptiom:This Python script, executed on the Google Colab platform, showcases a text generation task using a pretrained GPT-2 language model from the Hugging Face Transformers library, in combination with PyTorch. The code imports essential tools such as GPT2LMHeadModel and GPT2Tokenizer to handle model inference and token processing, while leveraging PyTorch's torch.device to automatically detect and utilize GPU acceleration, if available. The model is set to evaluation mode to ensure deterministic behavior during inference. A text generation function, generate_text, takes an input prompt, tokenizes it, and then generates a response using sampling parameters like top_k, top_p, temperature, and no_repeat_ngram_size to enhance creativity and coherence. Multiple prompts such as “The future of artificial intelligence is” and “Once upon a time in a village” are passed to the function, producing unique, contextually relevant completions. Google Colab’s GPU-backed environment makes this possible even without local high-end hardware, enabling efficient experimentation in natural language processing tasks. The application areas for such text generation include creative writing, storytelling, virtual assistants, marketing content automation, medical documentation, and educational tools. This project demonstrates how powerful AI capabilities can be accessed and integrated using open-source tools and cloud infrastructure, lowering the barrier for developers and researchers to explore advanced NLP tasks.

Prompt: The future of artificial intelligence is
The attention mask and the pad token id were not set. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:50256 for open-end generation.
The future of artificial intelligence is uncertain. The question is whether it will eventually be able to become fully human.

The first step is to design AI in advance of our own. But such an initial process is an uphill challenge. Until recently, many studies were focused on the possibility of AI becoming fully integrated with human intelligence. Even the most ambitious AI programs are not quite ready. Many early efforts were slow, though, and the process of building a human-machine interaction (AI) system was

Prompt: Once upon a time in a village

Once upon a time in a village, you are in need of food. And there are few of them, of course, and you will have to fight the same way as other villagers. It is not only that you cannot afford food, but you must also have children. When you have no food and no child, there is no room for a good family life.

You will be called upon to live and work in the village and to do good works, until you meet a beautiful girl

Prompt: Machine learning in healthcare can
Machine learning in healthcare can give doctors and nurses the ability to help patients who are in the same room or on the floor, or who have multiple diagnoses or are at risk of developing multiple sclerosis.

"There are so many things that are missing from the whole medical profession," says John Davenport, director of the nonprofit Grist, "all of which have to be done in a collaborative way."
